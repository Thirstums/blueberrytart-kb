> #### Thoughts 
> Today I felt very frustated once agian having to go to work and basically wasting 10h of my day. doing nothing insanely useful except staring at a screen and programming boring things. I lately have some sleepless nights. I am just wondering on how people are doing it. how do they build their own independent business and passive income. I hate having to go to work. But it'll be necessairy till I reach my goals. For now I have to do what has to be done in order to move further and succeed.
