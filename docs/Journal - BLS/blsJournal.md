>Today I had a headache for the whole day, so I ended up going into a Focus room due to I like the quiet in there. I was able to look at both of the things I wanted to look at but I'll have to refresh tomorrow due to my Headache made it hard to keep all the information. I also spent some time resting. Another thing I did was trying out new Docusaurus things. Next goal for docusaurus is to add a search function.
