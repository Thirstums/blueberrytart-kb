>Today was a rather bad day for me, I wasn't in the greatest mood and Progress wasn't great either.. I aspire to be more efficient in the future and set better goals for the day's. I was able to learn about Conditional Rendering and Rendering Lists, which was very interesting. Overall I am not happy with the day tho. lets make tommorrow a Better day.
